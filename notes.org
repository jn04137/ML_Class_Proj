* Notes

** GaussianNB

*** Var-Smoothing
+ At the default value using the cross_val_method, the GaussianNB model results in a mean score of 0.795

*** Cross_Val_Score
- the parameter n_jobs can be set to -1 to utilize all processor cores on the computer. This should speed up models such as 'leave-one-out'.

*** Things that need to be done

**** TODO Test for optimal var_smoothing value
+ The value ending up being 1e-5. This value ended up giving the best cross validation score of around 0.805

** SVC

** General Notes
+ We decided to remove some features after scoring for predictive impact. It was after getting the max_iter on SVC to 2,000,000 and still receiving convergence warnings that made us set out for other solutions.
