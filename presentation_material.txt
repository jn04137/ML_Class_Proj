1. Linear Regression - how it didnt work
	Due to the nature of LR
	We had a binary problem and LR is suppose to work across a range of Ys
4. MLP Classiffier (nuernal network) - 85
	We did with and without the testing set and it was the same outcome just a different path to get there

2. Gausian Naive bays - 81-82
3. Support Vector Machine SVM - 81--82
